## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Brief Injective Protocol Overview
#### Decentralization
The Injective Chain is a fully-decentralized sidechain relayer network which serves as a layer- 2 derivatives platform,trade execution coordinator (TEC), and decentralized orderbook.The core consensus is Tendermint- based.

#### Speed
The Injective Chain provides a two-way Ethereum peg-zone for Ether and ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to the Injective Chain as well as an EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications. The peg-zone is based off of Peggy and the EVM execution is based off of Ethermint.

#### Orderbook Model
Injective's Orderbook is a fully decentralized 0x-based orderbook, enabling sidechain order relay with on - chain settlement - a decentralized implementation of the traditionally centralized off-chain order relay used by nearly all central limit order book decentralized exchanges.

#### Markets
Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This enables anyone to create a market using only a price feed and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem.

#### Gas fees
Given the unique layer-2 structure, Injective is able to avoid both network congestion and the associated high gas fees. This zero gas fee structure can enable anyone to trade freely without having to worry about high gas fees or network latencies.

### Overview
#### The problem
Many DEXs today claim to be decentralized but are actually centralized in most aspects besides custody. From restricting access to certain user demographics, retaining proprietary control over exchange infrastructure, every central limit orderbook DEX that we have seen has centralized components that allow traders to be subject to the will of an omnipotent authority. This is the fundamental problem that Injective solves.

The common rationale against full decentralization is that efficiency and user experience are sacrificed. We at Injective reject this notion and have committed ourselves to turning the vision of a highly performant, permissionless, and fully-decentralized exchange protocol into reality.

A numeber of DEXes remain in the space but the attention is largely dedicated to Etheruem thus far. However, we believe that in a longer term time span, new robust ecosystems will arise on other layer ones. So being siloed to Ethereum especially given the high gas fees and low throughput isssues is not sustainable for the growth of the decentralized finance sector as a whole. That is why Injective aspires to brdge together popular layer ones in the space today. This will allow us to be the core derivatives exchnage via which distinct asset types can be exchanged with ease. This will also help in reaching our goal of supporting unlimited markets.

Over the past year we have noticed an uptick in development within the Polkadot ecosystems with a number of new assets/DApps launching on Polkadot. This is why we seek to bridge Polkadot to our derivatives exchange in order to integrate its ecosystem with the wider DeFi networks that remain concerntated on Ethereum as of now.

#### The solution
The biggest fundamental difference between Injective Protocol and other exchanges is that we make exchange a decentralized public utility which gives our users and community the resultant value capture from our exchange protocol.

Our technology brings an order of magnitude speedup by scaling trade execution and settlement on layer- 2 all while being fully decentralized.Injectiveâ€™s fully decentralized nature uniquely allows individuals to permissionlessly create and trade derivative markets that even centralized exchanges cannot support.

A salient challenge that remains in this process is the actual bridging of asset between distinct blockchains. Polkadot is quite compelling in this regard since it consists of different parachains that can easily communicate with one another. So, we seek to bridge the Injective Chain with the Polkadot network in order to unlock the full potenital of borderless finance and decentralized derivatives as a whole. By doing this we can allow for the creation of new markets that utilize DOT and other Polkadot based assets.

#### The application

A bridge for assets between Injective Chain and the Moonbeam parachain, which is part of the Polkadot ecosystem, will greatly ebenfit Polkadot and the larger crypto ecosystem. 

Injective offers limitless trading for both native crypto assets and synthetic products. This also includes the creation of new financial markets as a whole such as indices and other asset types not yet available in crypto.

With this bridge, Polkadot users will be able to easily transfer their assets and take part in cross-chain trading. It will also allow us to create new derivative products that use DOT and other Polkadot based assets. This also enables users of other layer ones to move their assets and earnings back to Polkadot; thereby acclerating the adoption of Polkadot overall. These users can also move their earnings back to Polkadot which can help the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem on Polkadot by locking up more assets on Polkadot.

To conclude, this application could result in a very interesting win-win situation between Injective  and Polkadot.

### Project Details

Generally, the bridge will allow assets to be transfered to and from Polkadot. That means that tokens will be able to be transferred from their native chain to the other chain as wrapped tokens, but those wrapped assets can also be transferred back to the native chain.  
  
The procedure will be exactly the same for both chains (same smart contracts, same relayer handling).  
  
The bridge will consist of three main components:

1) Smart Contracts  
2) Relayer Software  
3) UI  
  
#### Smart Contracts  
All smart contracts will be written in Solidity, as both Moonbeam and Injective support EVM based smart contract development.  
 
We will create three smart contracts for the bridge's purpose:  
 
a) Depositor smart contract  

The depositor smart contract will be responsible for accepting the deposits of the assets that users would like to bridge.  
Once the assets are deposited in this smart contract, they will be locked until an order from a multisig smart contract to unlock is given.  
 
b) Handler smart contract 

A handler smart contract will be actually the opposite of the depositor smart contract. When a deposit of an asset (native or wrapped) is happening on one chain, the handler will be responsible for minting the same asset (wrapped or native) on the destination chain.  
 
c) Multisig smart contract

A multisig smart contract will actually act as a voting contract for the validators and as the owner of the handler. Validators, the number of which is yet to be determined, will need to reach consensus about the validity of a deposit to provide permission for the handler smart contract to mint.  
  
#### Relayer Software
The relayer software will be responsible for the smooth functioning of the bridge, as it will handle event listening and provide permissions. 
 
The main relayers will actually be responsible for listening to the deposit events of the entry chain and transfer the data on the mMltisig of the destination chain. 

There will be two main relayers one for each chain. 
 
There will be other relayers, called validators which will listen to the OpenVote event of Multisig. When such an event occurs it means that validators will need to vote about the validity of the deposit. Validators will then need to sign their vote with their private keys and pass it to the Multisig.

The last validator to reach the Multisig will also trigger the vote result. 
 
If there is no consensus, a VoteFailed event is triggered and the main relayer of the respective chain unlocks the deposit, so that the can withdraw it. 
 
If there is consensus, assets will appear on the destination chain of the wallet that the depositor passed as input on the deposit function.

There will be also other features added, like cancellation of a deposit in case a transaction is taking too long to execute (because of low gas fees etc).

Those features will certainly be provided alongside the Relayer Software milestone because it is widely known that some edge cases cannot be considered before the real development starts. 

#### UI
Through the intuitive UI, users will be able to interact with the bridge we implement. It will contain a web3 connection to both chains and the essential deposit tab.

### Ecosystem Fit 
As described above, bridging Polkadot assets with Injective will be a robust addition to the polkadot ecosystem as a whole. This will enable the creation and trading of limitless cross-chain derivatives. This will be greatly beneficial to the Polkadot community as a whole and introduce new users to Polkadot based assets.
