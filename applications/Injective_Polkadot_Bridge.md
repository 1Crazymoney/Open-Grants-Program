# Open Grant Proposal
* **Project Name:** Injective_Polkadot_bridge
* **Team Name:** Injective Protocol
* **Payment Address:** 0xc104B47ea3D9B854CE0F3628f3A4a0A1bCD482dD

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Brief Injective Protocol Overview
#### Decentralization
The Injective Chain is a fully-decentralized sidechain relayer network which serves as a layer- 2 derivatives platform,trade execution coordinator(TEC), and decentralized orderbook.The core consensus is Tendermint- based.

#### Speed
The Injective Chain provides a two-way Ethereum peg-zone for Ether and ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to the Injective Chain as well as an EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications. The peg-zone is based off Peggy and the EVM execution is based off Ethermint.

#### Orderbook Model
Injective's Orderbook is a fully decentralized 0x-based orderbook enabling sidechain order relay with on - chain settlement - a decentralized implementation of the traditionally centralized off-chain order relay used by nearly all central limit order book decentralized exchanges.

#### Markets
Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This enables anyone to create a market using only a price feed and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem.

#### Gas fees
Given the unique layer-2 structure, Injective is able to avoid both network congestion and the associated high gas fees.This zero gas fee structure can enable anyone to trade freely without having to worry about high gas fees or network latencies.

### Overview
#### The problems
Decentralized finance ecosystem and generally cryptocurrencies are getting more and more attention as years go by.
This big expose is digging up some of the big weaknesses of the ecosystem though.
The most important issues arised are:
 * Scalability
 * Fees
 * Connectivity
 
The first two issues are visible to the most popular cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Especially on big market moves, blockchains like the previously mentioned ones, which are not designed to process a lot of transactions per second struggle to serve on market needs, which results in pending transactions forever if fees paid are not big enough.

A lot of cryptocurrencies' blockchains have been designed to solve those problems, without any of those establishing itself in the ecosystem. And that happens because the third issue exists, which is connectivity.

It is not overstatement to say that Ethereum is holding the decentralized finance's keys. Almost all assets and DEFI applications are part of its ecosystem and it is hard for them to move to other blockchains.

#### The solution
Thus the biggest challenge nowadays is to bridge assets (which also means decentralized applications) between different blockchains.

Polkadot ecosystem is creating big expectations for that reason. An ecosystem that is consisting of different parachains, which are easily communicating with each other. Polkadot will also be able to communicate with Ethereum Blockchain, while it will offer much lower fees and much more transactions per second.

For all those reasons, Polkadot is becoming more and more popular among cryptocurrencies and a huge variety of projects are trying to become part of its ecosystem.

#### The application
Injective Protocol is not in a different situation. A bridge for assets between Injective Chain and Moonbeam parachain, which is part of Polkadot ecosystem will benefit both ecosystems.

Injective Protocol is offering unlimited trading for assets inside the cryptocurrencies' ecosystem, but also for forex and stocks.

With this bridge, Polkadot users will be able to easily transfer their assets and enjoy trading on Injective exchange and then move their earnings back to Polkadot and benefit from all decentralized applications there.

To conclude with, this application could result in a very interesting win-win situation between Injective Protocol and Polkadot.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)
