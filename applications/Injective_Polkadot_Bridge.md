# Open Grant Proposal
* **Project Name:** Injective_Polkadot_bridge
* **Team Name:** Injective Protocol
* **Payment Address:** 0xc104B47ea3D9B854CE0F3628f3A4a0A1bCD482dD

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Brief Injective Protocol Overview
#### Decentralization
The Injective Chain is a fully-decentralized sidechain relayer network which serves as a layer- 2 derivatives platform,trade execution coordinator(TEC), and decentralized orderbook.The core consensus is Tendermint- based.

#### Speed
The Injective Chain provides a two-way Ethereum peg-zone for Ether and ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to the Injective Chain as well as an EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications. The peg-zone is based off Peggy and the EVM execution is based off Ethermint.

#### Orderbook Model
Injective's Orderbook is a fully decentralized 0x-based orderbook enabling sidechain order relay with on - chain settlement - a decentralized implementation of the traditionally centralized off-chain order relay used by nearly all central limit order book decentralized exchanges.

#### Markets
Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This enables anyone to create a market using only a price feed and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem.

#### Gas fees
Given the unique layer-2 structure, Injective is able to avoid both network congestion and the associated high gas fees.This zero gas fee structure can enable anyone to trade freely without having to worry about high gas fees or network latencies.

### Overview
#### The problems
Decentralized finance ecosystem and generally cryptocurrencies are getting more and more attention as years go by.
This big expose is digging up some of the big weaknesses of the ecosystem though.
The most important issues arised are:
 * Scalability
 * Fees
 * Connectivity
 
The first two issues are visible to the most popular cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Especially on big market moves, blockchains like the previously mentioned ones, which are not designed to process a lot of transactions per second struggle to serve on market needs, which results in pending transactions forever if fees paid are not big enough.

A lot of cryptocurrencies' blockchains have been designed to solve those problems, without any of those establishing itself in the ecosystem. And that happens because the third issue exists, which is connectivity.

It is not overstatement to say that Ethereum is holding the decentralized finance's keys. Almost all assets and DEFI applications are part of its ecosystem and it is hard for them to move to other blockchains.

#### The solution
Thus the biggest challenge nowadays is to bridge assets (which also means decentralized applications) between different blockchains.

Polkadot ecosystem is creating big expectations for that reason. An ecosystem that is consisting of different parachains, which are easily communicating with each other. Polkadot will also be able to communicate with Ethereum Blockchain, while it will offer much lower fees and much more transactions per second.

For all those reasons, Polkadot is becoming more and more popular among cryptocurrencies and a huge variety of projects are trying to become part of its ecosystem.

#### The application
Injective Protocol is not in a different situation. A bridge for assets between Injective Chain and Moonbeam parachain, which is part of Polkadot ecosystem will benefit both ecosystems.

Injective Protocol is offering unlimited trading for assets inside the cryptocurrencies' ecosystem, but also for forex and stocks.

With this bridge, Polkadot users will be able to easily transfer their assets and enjoy trading on Injective exchange and then move their earnings back to Polkadot and benefit from all decentralized applications there.

To conclude with, this application could result in a very interesting win-win situation between Injective Protocol and Polkadot.

Eric Chen (CEO)-  Eric previously attended NYU Stern where he studied finance and computer science. Before founding Injective, he worked as a cryptography researcher and trader at Innovating Capital where he led innovative market neutral trading efforts in the blockchain space as well as investments into prominent companies such as 0x, ChainLink and Cosmos. Eric has extensive knowledge about blockchain protocols and traditional finance along with a native understanding of both eastern and western blockchain based protocols and communities. 

Albert Chon (CTO) - Albert previously attended Stanford University where he studied computer science and was involved in applied cryptography research advised under Dan Boneh (prominent Stanford cryptography Professor). Before founding Injective, he worked at Amazon as a software developer as well as Open Zeppelin. Albert invented the ERC-1178 token standard which was adopted by Loom Network for NFTs. Having lived in South Korea, Albert also has a keen understanding of the retail trading community in South Korea as well as relationships with key strategic partners in the region.

Mirza Uddin (Head of Business Development) - Mirza was previously on the investment team at Two Sigma (one of the largest hedge funds in the world), where he focused on investments into blockchain based technologies. He also was part of the investment team at Index Ventures. Prior to his work in VC and startups, Mirza held roles in management consulting at BCG and in investment banking. Mirza graduated with a BA from Harvard.

Maxim Kupriianov (Principal Engineer) - Maxim has 11 years of programming experience and has a diverse set of experience building back-end infrastructure at numerous startups. Prior to joining Injective, he was the lead blockchain engineer at Atlant where he led development of a real estate tokenization platform on top of Ethereum and authored the ERC-1462 security token standard. He notably also has 3 years of experience using Tendermint/Cosmos-SDK which he used in its early days to design an in-game blockchain based reward system for a distributed MMORPG at Gamma Innovations (acquired). Maxim is also an avid open-source contributor and is an expert in the Go programming language. 

Michael Siedlecki (Software Engineer) - Michael has 10 years of programming experience and was an early/founding-engineer at several Y-Combinator funded startups.

Coming from a centralized exchange that went head-to-head with FTX, Michael spearheaded multiple derivatives trading competitions and has a very good understanding of product and growth-hacking.

Markus Waas (Blockchain Engineer) - Markus has 10 years of programming experience and has over 8 years of crypto-specific experience. He began mining Bitcoin in 2012 and has worked at several blockchain companies/projects in the past. Before joining Injective, Markus was a smart contract engineer at Laminar/Acala where he created a Forex CFD margin trading platform on Ethereum. Markus also worked at Juri where he designed and implemented a new type of staking pool as well as a fully decentralized oracle system. Markus graduated from Humboldt University in Berlin where he wrote his master’s thesis on randomness on the blockchain and has won awards at numerous Ethereum hackathons including ETHBerlin and Blockstack Berlin. He is a Solidity expert and is the author of https://soliditydeveloper.com.
